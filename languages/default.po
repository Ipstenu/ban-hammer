"edit your functions.php and block the domain, once you get past a few bad "

"On a single install of WP, instead of using its own database table, Ban "
"Hammer pulls from your list of blacklisted emails from the Comment Blacklist "
"feature, native to WordPress.  Since emails never equal IP addresses, it "
"simply skips over and ignores them. On a network instance, there's a network "
"wide setting for banned emails and domains. This means you only have "
"<em>one</em> place to update and maintain your blacklist.  When a "
"blacklisted user attempts to register, they get a customizable message that "
"they cannot register."
